# paintJOGL
A basic painting applicaton with the ability to grow limitlessly !

Altough it is in a very basic stage now, it has the capability of expanding much more, thanks to the modular nature of the coding, in which the basic framework is kept independent and all the paint/drawing tools are added separately as modules upon the core framework.

## Built with
Java and OpenGL, with JOGL being used as the OpenGL libraries for Java.
Built using/upon IntelliJ IDEA.

## Details about the project
An exhaustive list of features, hardware requirements, bugs/issues solved/present, future scope of the software, and a lot more can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4dzlcxveG-xQlprTGV1bWlOQnM).

## How to build/use
Please make sure a Java development environment is setup on the system you want to build. It is best to download and use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for the develpment of this app.

<b><i>If using IntelliJ,</i></b> simply export the project folder as a "New Project" in IntelliJ. To build, simply follow the steps elucidated [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1082580/how-to-build-jars-from-intellij-properly).

<b><i>If not using IntelliJ,</i></b> the folder [src](https://github.com/zakee94/paintJOGL/tree/linux/src) contains the source code in .java files, [rsc](https://github.com/zakee94/paintJOGL/tree/linux/rsc) contains all the resources such as images (vectors) for icons, etc and [JOGL lib](https://github.com/zakee94/paintJOGL/tree/linux/JOGL%20lib) contains the necessary JOGL libraries (varies with branch) required for building the applicaton. Only these 3 folders and their contents are sufficient and necessary for building and working upon this applicaton.
